# Devops
ci/cd pipeline operations
DevOps pipeline is a combination of automation, tools, and practices across the SDLC to facilitate the development and deployment of software into the hands of end users. Critically, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to building a DevOps pipeline and they often vary in design and implementation from one organization to another. 
Most DevOps pipelines, however, involve automation, continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), automated testing, reporting, and monitoring.
